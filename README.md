## 📖 Overview

Stock price prediction is a critical yet complex task due to the inherent volatility and non-linearity of financial markets. Traditional time-series models often fail to capture interdependencies between financial entities and macroeconomic influences.

This project aims to provide an interface for an actionable decision using a modular, agentic system powered by large language models (LLMs) and real-time web search.

- Technologies used
o       Google Drive + JSON cache for storage
o       Gradio UI for live demos and interaction
o       FastAPI for future scalability and Angular UI
