Economists anticipate potential rate cuts in the latter half of FY25, contingent on inflation trends and global economic conditions.

This downward trend may provide the RBI with room for further rate cuts to stimulate economic activity.

([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/909daa6733be375817d9d37ceb98dc6b?utm_source=openai)) Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) is a major player in this sector, contributing significantly to India's renewable energy capacity. The company is involved in large-scale projects like the Gujarat Hybrid Renewable Energy Park, where it has been allocated 19,000 hectares for a permitted capacity of 9,500 MW. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Hybrid_Renewable_Energy_Park?utm_source=openai)) AGEL has set an ambitious target to achieve 45 GW of renewable power by 2030.
